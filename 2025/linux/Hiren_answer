**Managing Users, Groups, and SSH Access in Linux**
This guide will help you create a new user, assign them to a group, grant administrative privileges, and restrict SSH access for specific accounts.

---

## **1️⃣ Creating a New User**
To add a new user named `devops_user`, use this command:  
```bash
sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash devops_user
```
- The `-m` flag ensures a home directory (`/home/devops_user`) is created.  
- The `-s /bin/bash` part sets Bash as the default shell.  

To confirm the user was created, check:
```bash
cat /etc/passwd | grep devops_user
```

---

## **2️⃣ Creating a Group and Adding the User**
Now, let’s create a group called `devops_team` and add `devops_user` to it.

Create the group:
```bash
sudo groupadd devops_team
```
Add the user to this group:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG devops_team devops_user
```
Verify:
```bash
cat /etc/group | grep devops_team
```

---

## **3️⃣ Assigning a Password to the User**
Set a password for `devops_user` by running:
```bash
sudo passwd devops_user
```
You’ll be prompted to enter a password twice.

---

## **4️⃣ Granting Admin Privileges**
To allow `devops_user` to execute administrative commands, add them to the `sudo` group:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG sudo devops_user
```
Alternatively, open the sudoers file for direct modifications:
```bash
sudo visudo
```
Add this line at the end:
```
devops_user ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
```
Save and exit the file.

---

## **5️⃣ Controlling SSH Access**
To limit who can log in via SSH:

1. Edit the SSH configuration:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   ```
2. To **block specific users**, add:
   ```
   DenyUsers root testuser
   ```
   Or, to **allow only specific users**, add:
   ```
   AllowUsers devops_user
   ```
3. Save the file and restart SSH:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart sshd
   ```
4. Check SSH logs to ensure the changes are working:
   ```bash
   sudo cat /var/log/auth.log | grep "sshd"
   ```

✔ Added the user to a custom group (`devops_team`).  
✔ Set up a password.
